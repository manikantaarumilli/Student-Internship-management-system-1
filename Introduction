*******INTRODUCTION TO THE PROJECT******

We are a group of five people working on a project about student internships. my name is Anusha Poreddy. 
We have made the decision to set up a website where students can find internship opportunities.
We establish a connection between the student, administrators, and companies on this website. 
We establish three registers, including those for students, administrators, and companies.
Students can register for a profile and look for employment that fit their qualifications. 
Companies can publish job offers and a summary of the position on our company login page.
The admin login page is now available, allowing admin to create accounts, accept student profiles, and approve company articles.
We have a problem where companies and students manipulate the program by creating false profiles.
We are generating a super admin login to look into this problem and has full ability to prevent the fake profiles in order to solve it.
